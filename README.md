This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run the project?

Clone the repository using:

`git clone https://github.com/melhaer/ntl.git`

Once the repo is cloned on your local drive run:

`npm install`

Once all npm packages are successfully created on your machine, run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

To connect the repo with the json-server, open the `https://github.com/melhaer/ntl/tree/master/api` folder on your local machine na use console to run `npm start` in a different window. 

It will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you will be able to see the JSON structure at [http://localhost:3001/quotes](http://localhost:3001/quotes)

Now you should have both localhosts 3000 and 3001 running.

Enjoy!
